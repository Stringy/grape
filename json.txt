I'm using an enumerator/class I found on a website for playing the sound, and the code looks... well, sound... so I'm not sure what the problem is. I will include links to the sounds enum and the particular piece of code where I am using it. Can someone tell me why they think it might not be playing properly?

Sounds Enum: http://pastebin.com/Hqt5dPQ6
Playing the Sound: http://pastebin.com/LQLNS8hE

The Sounds enum is initialized in the constructor of the framework in which I play the sound. It plays once, so I know it's initialized properly. What I don't understand is why it only works once. It stops the sound if already playing and rewinds it before playing.

I appreciate any help.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that when the sound DOES play, the game freezes momentarily while the sound plays. It will continue to play if the button is held down, but once released, it will no longer play. link_flair_css_class:<nil> banned_by:<nil> likes:<nil> id:1es2pe media:<nil> hidden:false author_flair_css_class:<nil> saved:false is_self:true created_utc:1.369161444e+09 distinguished:<nil> downs:1 url:http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1es2pe/java_cant_play_sound_more_than_once/ ups:12 name:t3_1es2pe created:1.369190244e+09 author_flair_text:<nil> thumbnail: edited:1.36916268e+09 author:packetpirate domain:self.learnprogramming selftext_html:&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just recently picked up a project of mine from a while back that I really want to finish, but I have a problem with the sound.

I understand that "." refers to a member of an object and "-&gt;" refers to a member of a pointer to an object, but I don't understand the need for the distinction. What grammar caused the need to tell these two apart? Is it a holdover from when our compilers were not as smart as they can be now? Or is it just to remind the programmer that he is working with a pointer and needs to be more careful with what he's doing (at the price of efficiency)?

All techniques demonstrated are implemented in my game **[TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)**, which is currently **[Kickstarting](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep)** (only 10 days of funding left to go!)


Interactive demos for Parts 1, 1.1 &amp; Part 2 are at the usual place:

http://tinykeep.com/ai


**Part 1 Improvements**

Before I crack on with Part 2, I want to quickly mention some minor improvements I've made to Part 1 as a result of community feedback from Reddit and elsewhere. Thanks everyone for helping me improve on the AI so far!

[Part 1.1 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/YttkpNdS5bY)

In short, the changes are: 

1 . The co-ordinate of the last detected entity (either player character or breadcrumb) is saved as a variable every frame. So, while in Alert mode, if the Skeleton loses sight and smell of the target (all raycasts to the player character or dropped breadcrumbs return false), he will still continue to head towards this last detected location as its final target and re-evaluate from there. This is an improvement from the previous version where a monster would stop and go back to patrolling even though it has detected a target in the past - which is not expected behaviour.

2 . If the Skeleton still cannot detect anything from this point (all raycasts to the player and breadcrumbs again return false), Alert mode is dropped and the monster makes a "best guess" where the character is and sets the patrol waypoint target. For this initial version, the "best guess" is simply the nearest waypoint to the character at the time. If the character moves away after this point, the best guess waypoint remains the same. I admit it's a little bit cheaty of the AI - since it now knows exactly where the character is in order to set the waypoint - but it works well and looks realistic enough because of its slow movement during non-alert patrol mode. Most players won't know the difference, it just looks like the the monster is heading in the general direction and its likely the player has moved on from this point anyway. Still - for completeness I may modify best guess to take into account the target's last seen velocity and extrapolate from there.

Given these changes, we've removed the alert level (range 0-200 etc...) as we've found this feature has become redundant and offers no extra intelligence. It has simply been replaced with a boolean, so either alert or not. The "smell trails" have also been shortened significantly to balance out the extra added behaviours - with the last detected code there is no need to have such a long trail, lest we give the impression that the AI is cheating all of the time! This also gives the player the opportunity to hide behind corners and ambush monsters walking past.

Let's move on to the fun stuff!


**TinyKeep AI System (Part 2 of 5) : Retreating and Defense**

Today we'll be following a little Fire Imp as we discuss Retreating and Defensive behaviours. Fire Imps (and other monsters marked with the "Shy" personality flag) will run away from the player if he gets too close. Put him in this level of distress for too long, and he'll breathe fire on you, while still attempting to flee.

[Part 2 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/dIBuIELYd4c)

1 . For the demo, Fire Imps in non-alert mode stay in one position, although other Shy monsters may roam/patrol in the same way as Skeletons. The Fire Imp is constantly looking around for signs of danger - every approximate second or so the monster rotates between a random range of -270 to 270.

2 . Like the Skeletons, the Fire Imps employ line of sight, the FOV being slightly greater than the Skeletons due to it being prey and not predator. If a raycast to a threat returns true (threat being the player or aggressive monster), Alert mode is turned on and the Fire Imp faces the target. It will continue to face the target while in Alert mode, as long as it can still see and smell the target. At this point the Fire Imp will not flee just yet - the target is not close enough to be a major threat, but it is alerted and wary, and constantly tracking you with its sight.

3 . While in Alert mode, if the player exceeds a certain distance threshold then the Fire Imp begins the flee. We use an inverse of the Seek Steering Behaviour, which creates the Flee Steering Behaviour. (Subtract the destination vector from the source vector, rather than the other way around). The resultant vector is normalized and scaled to the Fire Imp's max speed, so now the monster is repelled away from the player if it gets too close.

4 . Unlike the Seek Behaviour, Fleeing comes with a greater risk of getting stuck on walls and sharp corners. Because it is being repelled by the player, the target destination could be anything - a wall, another monster etc.. We don't get this problem with Seeking, because the target is always the player, who is always in the an empty space. To prevent problems with getting stuck - we must increase the wall avoidance distance. The Fire Imp now follows the corridors and rooms rather getting stuck on them. This is also useful for when the Imp is stuck in a corner - it will slide nicely away if the player tries to advance further.

5 . Each monster has it's own type of defensive behaviours while retreating. For this demo, if the Fire Imp is in Alert mode and is being chased around for a sustained period of time, it will begin to breathe fire at the player. This is simply a fire particle with a velocity towards the player at the time. Fire particles are short lived and decay after a second. If the Fire Imp is no longer being chased or comes off Alert mode, a cooldown period is activated before it breathes fire again.

And that's it! Quite simple reactive behaviour but effective. I did try to use some kind of pathfinding to accomplish fleeing but the results were buggy and there was a lot more consideration required to make it look realistic. In the end the reactive technique using Fleeing Steering Behaviour returned better results. The key takeaway with game AI is that a combination of simpler rules often work better than a monolithic and complicated top-down system. Also - exaggerate your behaviours! Make them look around often, give them surprised animations, make use of sounds and speech. It doesn't matter how intelligent the AI is, if the player isn't given cues as to what is going on under the hood - the monsters will not SEEM intelligent.

&lt;p&gt;Given these changes, we&amp;#39;ve removed the alert level (range 0-200 etc...) as we&amp;#39;ve found this feature has become redundant and offers no extra intelligence. It has simply been replaced with a boolean, so either alert or not. The &amp;quot;smell trails&amp;quot; have also been shortened significantly to balance out the extra added behaviours - with the last detected code there is no need to have such a long trail, lest we give the impression that the AI is cheating all of the time! This also gives the player the opportunity to hide behind corners and ambush monsters walking past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s move on to the fun stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TinyKeep AI System (Part 2 of 5) : Retreating and Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;#39;ll be following a little Fire Imp as we discuss Retreating and Defensive behaviours. Fire Imps (and other monsters marked with the &amp;quot;Shy&amp;quot; personality flag) will run away from the player if he gets too close. Put him in this level of distress for too long, and he&amp;#39;ll breathe fire on you, while still attempting to flee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/dIBuIELYd4c"&gt;Part 2 YouTube Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 . For the demo, Fire Imps in non-alert mode stay in one position, although other Shy monsters may roam/patrol in the same way as Skeletons. The Fire Imp is constantly looking around for signs of danger - every approximate second or so the monster rotates between a random range of -270 to 270.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 . Like the Skeletons, the Fire Imps employ line of sight, the FOV being slightly greater than the Skeletons due to it being prey and not predator. If a raycast to a threat returns true (threat being the player or aggressive monster), Alert mode is turned on and the Fire Imp faces the target. It will continue to face the target while in Alert mode, as long as it can still see and smell the target. At this point the Fire Imp will not flee just yet - the target is not close enough to be a major threat, but it is alerted and wary, and constantly tracking you with its sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 . While in Alert mode, if the player exceeds a certain distance threshold then the Fire Imp begins the flee. We use an inverse of the Seek Steering Behaviour, which creates the Flee Steering Behaviour. (Subtract the destination vector from the source vector, rather than the other way around). The resultant vector is normalized and scaled to the Fire Imp&amp;#39;s max speed, so now the monster is repelled away from the player if it gets too close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 . Unlike the Seek Behaviour, Fleeing comes with a greater risk of getting stuck on walls and sharp corners. Because it is being repelled by the player, the target destination could be anything - a wall, another monster etc.. We don&amp;#39;t get this problem with Seeking, because the target is always the player, who is always in the an empty space. To prevent problems with getting stuck - we must increase the wall avoidance distance. The Fire Imp now follows the corridors and rooms rather getting stuck on them. This is also useful for when the Imp is stuck in a corner - it will slide nicely away if the player tries to advance further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 . Each monster has it&amp;#39;s own type of defensive behaviours while retreating. For this demo, if the Fire Imp is in Alert mode and is being chased around for a sustained period of time, it will begin to breathe fire at the player. This is simply a fire particle with a velocity towards the player at the time. Fire particles are short lived and decay after a second. If the Fire Imp is no longer being chased or comes off Alert mode, a cooldown period is activated before it breathes fire again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it! Quite simple reactive behaviour but effective. I did try to use some kind of pathfinding to accomplish fleeing but the results were buggy and there was a lot more consideration required to make it look realistic. In the end the reactive technique using Fleeing Steering Behaviour returned better results. The key takeaway with game AI is that a combination of simpler rules often work better than a monolithic and complicated top-down system. Also - exaggerate your behaviours! Make them look around often, give them surprised animations, make use of sounds and speech. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how intelligent the AI is, if the player isn&amp;#39;t given cues as to what is going on under the hood - the monsters will not SEEM intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;

I get the idea of sub and superclasses, but I'm having trouble implementing it.  I am creating a simple program called Trees that will initialize two trees, one of which is coniferous (never sheds its leaves) and deciduous (sheds leaves during winter).

I have created a class called Tree, which instantiates a coniferous tree that grows by one metre when the grow() method is called.  I have also created a subclass of Tree called DeciduousTree, that checks to see if the season is warm or cold, and sheds or buds its leaves accordingly, using a boolean value called leaves.  The DeciduousTree class has its own unique mutator method "leafStatus()" that accepts a string "warm" or "cold" to change its status.

For some reason, though, I cannot seem to call the leafStatus() method within the main program, it just seems to think that the method doesn't exist.  I don't understand what the problem is, can anybody enlighten me?

Here is the main class:

    public class Trees {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
        
            Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
            Tree pine = new Tree();
            Tree maple = new DeciduousTree();
            int seasonCounter = 0;
        
            do {
                System.out.println("Input Season:");
                String season = in.next();
                seasonCounter++;
                System.out.println("Season: " + season);
                pine.grow();
                maple.grow();
                maple.leafStatus(season);
            
            } while(!"q".equals(in.next()));
        }
    }

Here is the Tree superclass:

    public class Tree {
    
        protected double height;
    
        public Tree() {
            this.height = 1;
        }

            this.height += 1;
        }
    
        public String details() {
            return "This tree is " + this.height + " metres tall.";
        }
    }

And here is the DeciduousTree subclass:
